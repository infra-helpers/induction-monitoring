# Overview
[That repository](https://github.com/infra-helpers/induction-monitoring) aims
at providing end-to-end examples introducing how to collect, store
and query metering events, produced by different sensors
on local as well as on clouds.

Although the software stacks are very similar with logging,
the purpose is different. See the
[GitHub repository dedicated to logging](https://github.com/infra-helpers/induction-logging)
for further details.
